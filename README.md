### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a college student who loves learning everything about anything especially all things related to tech. I am still very new to the community and still trying to find my way around
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently participating in the #100DaysOfCode challenge
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Data Structures and Algorithms
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with learning the ropes of the industry and connecting with fellow community members

- âš¡ *Fun fact: I am infamous for coaxing people into trying new (read: wierd) flavors of ice-cream but always have the standard ones myself :trollface: Would you like some Wasabi :ice_cream: ??? :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes: *
