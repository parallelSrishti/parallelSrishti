### Hi there 👋

I am a college student who loves learning anything about everything especially all things related to tech. I am still very new to the community and still trying to find my way around
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Data Structures and Algorithms
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with learning the ropes of the industry and connecting with fellow community members

- ⚡ *Fun fact: I am infamous for coaxing people into trying new (read: wierd) flavors of ice-cream but always have the standard ones myself :trollface: Would you like some Wasabi :ice_cream: ??? :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes: *
